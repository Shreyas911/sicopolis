Ice thermodynamics
******************

For modelling ice thermodynamics, five different options are available, which can be chosen in the run-specs header by the parameter ``CALCMOD``\:

.. code-block:: fortran

  #define CALCMOD 3
  !                   -1 : ISOT: isothermal method,
  !                              constant temperature and age
  !                    0 : COLD: cold-ice method, resetting of temperatures
  !                              above pressure melting
  !                    1 : POLY: polythermal method,
  !                              separate domains for cold and temperate ice
  !                    2 : ENTC: conventional enthalpy method
  !                    3 : ENTM: melting-CTS enthalpy method
  !
  !                        For CALCMOD = -1, 0, 2, 3, the kt domain is redundant,
  !                        therefore KTMAX = 2 is recommended

This is the setting of simulation :file:`repo_emtp2sge25_expA`, for which the melting-CTS enthalpy method is selected.

Options ``1`` and ``3`` are the most sophisticated solvers and thus recommended for most real-world problems. The different methods are discussed by Greve and Blatter :cite:`greve_blatter_2016`.

As explained in Section ":ref:`spatial_grid`", for the polythermal method (POLY) separate vertical domains are employed for the cold-ice layer (:math:`\zeta_\mathrm{c}` domain) and the temperate-ice layer (:math:`\zeta_\mathrm{t}` domain). In all other cases, the :math:`\zeta_\mathrm{c}` domain is used for the entire ice column from the base to the surface, and the :math:`\zeta_\mathrm{t}` domain is redundant.

If the polythermal method is chosen (``CALCMOD = 1``), the parameter ``CTS_MELTING_FREEZING`` determines whether melting and freezing conditions are distinguished (``1``), or melting conditions are always assumed (``2``). In principle, the former is physically more adequate. However, in practice, freezing conditions occur only for a very small fraction of the areas with a temperate layer, and their treatment can cause numerical issues due to the discontinuities of the temperature gradient and the water content at the CTS (cold-temperate transition surface). Therefore, setting ``CTS_MELTING_FREEZING`` to ``2`` is safer and usually sufficient.
