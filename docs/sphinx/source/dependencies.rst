NetCDF
======

NetCDF (Network Common Data Form) is a common format for scientific data (`doi: 10.5065/D6H70CW6 <https://doi.org/10.5065/D6H70CW6>`__) that is also used by SICOPOLIS. The NetCDF C and Fortran libraries are required.

For **GCC**, installation from a package manager is recommended. Under openSUSE Leap 15.2, install netcdf, netcdf-devel, netcdf-devel-static, netcdf-fortran, netcdf-fortran-devel, netcdf-fortran-static, ncview. This requires the repositories "Software for Scientists and Engineers" and "sebschub's Home Project". Details (especially the required repositories) will differ for other systems.

For the **Intel compiler**, building from the source code is required. The C and Fortran sources are available for download on the `NetCDF website <https://doi.org/10.5065/D6H70CW6>`__ as zip or tar archives. Unzip the archives into temporary directories.

* Prior to version 4.2, a single archive contained both the C and Fortran libraries. A minimal installation for version 4.1.3 (without NetCDF-4 support) can be done by changing to the source directory, then::

    export NCDIR=/opt/netcdf
    export CC=icc
    export FC=ifort
    export CFLAGS="-O2"
    export CPPFLAGS=
    export FCFLAGS="-O2"
    export FFLAGS=${FCFLAGS}
    ./configure --prefix=${NCDIR} --libdir=${NCDIR}/lib \
                --disable-netcdf-4
    make install

* Since version 4.2, the C and Fortran libraries must be installed separately. If NetCDF-4 support is dispensable, the following installation should work (tested under openSUSE Leap 15.2 and icc/ifort 19.1 with versions netcdf-c-4.8.0 and netcdf-fortran-4.5.3 as of January 25, 2021).

  Change to the source directory of the C library, then::

    export NCDIR=/opt/netcdf
    export CC=icc
    export FC=ifort
    export CFLAGS="-O2"
    export CPPFLAGS=
    export FCFLAGS="-O2"
    export FFLAGS=${FCFLAGS}
    ./configure --prefix=${NCDIR} --libdir=${NCDIR}/lib \
                --disable-netcdf-4 --enable-logging
    make install

  Change to the source directory of the Fortran library, then::

    export NFDIR=/opt/netcdf
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${NCDIR}/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
    export CPPFLAGS=-I${NCDIR}/include
    export LDFLAGS=-L${NCDIR}/lib
    ./configure --prefix=${NFDIR} --libdir=${NFDIR}/lib \
                --disable-netcdf-4 --enable-logging
    make install

* A complete build with NetCDF-4 support requires additional libraries. Download the sources of the data-compression library **zlib** (https://www.zlib.net/), the Hierarchical Data Format **HDF5** (https://www.hdfgroup.org/) and the **NetCDF-4** C and Fortran libraries (https://doi.org/10.5065/D6H70CW6). Unpack all archives.

  Step 1: Installation of **zlib**. Change to the source directory, then::

    export ZDIR=/opt/zlib
    export CC=icc
    export FC=ifort
    export CFLAGS="-O2"
    export CPPFLAGS=
    export FCFLAGS="-O2"
    export FFLAGS=${FCFLAGS}
    ./configure --prefix=${ZDIR} --libdir=${ZDIR}/lib
    make check
    make install

  Step 2: Installation of **HDF5**. Change to the source directory, then::

    export ZDIR=/opt/zlib
    export H5DIR=/opt/hdf5
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${ZDIR}/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
    export CC=icc
    export FC=ifort
    export CFLAGS="-O2"
    export CPPFLAGS=
    export FCFLAGS="-O2"
    export FFLAGS=${FCFLAGS}
    ./configure --with-zlib=${ZDIR} \
                --prefix=${H5DIR} --libdir=${H5DIR}/lib \
                --enable-hl \
                --with-default-api-version=v18
    make check
    make install 

  Step 3: Installation of **NetCDF-4**. Change to the source directory of the C library, then::

    export ZDIR=/opt/zlib
    export H5DIR=/opt/hdf5
    export NCDIR=/opt/netcdf
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${H5DIR}/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
    export CC=icc
    export FC=ifort
    export CFLAGS="-O2"
    export CPPFLAGS="-I${H5DIR}/include -I${ZDIR}/include"
    export LDFLAGS="-L${H5DIR}/lib -L${ZDIR}/lib"
    export FCFLAGS="-O2"
    export FFLAGS=${FCFLAGS}
    ./configure --prefix=${NCDIR} --libdir=${NCDIR}/lib \
                --enable-logging --disable-dap-remote-tests
    make install
    make check

  Change to the source directory of the Fortran library, then::

    export NFDIR=/opt/netcdf
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${NCDIR}/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
    export CPPFLAGS=-I${NCDIR}/include
    export LDFLAGS=-L${NCDIR}/lib
    ./configure --prefix=${NFDIR} --libdir=${NFDIR}/lib \
                --enable-logging --disable-dap-remote-tests
    make install
    make check

  This was tested under openSUSE Leap 15.3 and icc/ifort 19.1 with versions netcdf-c-4.8.1 and netcdf-fortran-4.5.4 as of March 26, 2022.

  If installation from a package manager does not work out for GCC, try the above procedure, replacing everywhere 'icc' and 'ifort' by 'gcc' and 'gfortran', respectively.

If needed, further instructions can be found on the `NetCDF website <nc>`__.

Installation under /opt usually requires admin rights. The same holds for the common alternative /usr/local. For a local installation, replace it by '/home/<my_user_name>/local'.

.. _dependencies-lis:

Lis
===

Lis (Library of Iterative Solvers for linear systems) is a software library for solving discretized linear equations (Nishida :cite:`nishida_2010`).

Download the source of Lis as a zip archive from https://www.ssisc.org/lis/ (as of January 23, 2021: lis-2.0.30.zip). Unzip the archive and change to the source directory.

For **GCC**, install lis by executing::

  export LISDIR=/opt/lis
  ./configure --prefix=${LISDIR} --libdir=${LISDIR}/lib \
              --enable-fortran --enable-f90 \
              --enable-omp --enable-saamg --enable-fma \
              CC=gcc FC=gfortran F77=gfortran \
              CFLAGS="-mcmodel=medium" CPPFLAGS="-mcmodel=medium" \
              FCFLAGS="-mcmodel=medium" FFLAGS="-mcmodel=medium"
  make install

This has been tested under openSUSE Leap 15.2 and Linux Mint 20.1 (some modifications might be needed under different systems).

For the **Intel compiler**, replace 'gcc' and 'gfortran' by 'icc' and 'ifort', respectively.

Installation under /opt usually requires admin rights. The same holds for the common alternative /usr/local. For a local installation, replace it by '/home/<my_user_name>/local'.
