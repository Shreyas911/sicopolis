abstract = {A computational analysis of the accuracy of different approximations to the Stokes equations for momentum balance used in ice sheet modeling is performed by solving a particular tractable form of the equations appropriate for small perturbations of the ice surface, describing the uniform flow of ice with a Glen rheology on an infinitely long and broad section. The approximants comprise the shallow ice approximation and various schemes for incorporating longitudinal stresses and, in one case, the horizontal gradient of the horizontal plane shear stresses. The simplifications lead to a vertically one-dimensional numerical problem, whose solution can be computed rapidly. The relaxation rate of perturbations as well as other response descriptors for the stable full system and approximants are compared. Compared with the shallow ice approximation, the inclusion of longitudinal stresses increases accuracy at shorter wavelengths, but accuracy is poor at wavelengths around or less than the ice sheet thickness. Even though analysis shows that the horizontal gradients of the horizontal plane shear stresses are of similar magnitude to longitudinal stress effects, computations show, in agreement with glaciological belief, that longitudinal stress effects are more significant and need to be corrected for first in practice. Two schemes, a multilayer scheme and a one-layer scheme, are particularly good and should be investigated further in cases where perturbations from uniformity are large. Some other apparently plausible approximations introduce nonphysical instabilities. New schemes need to be assessed in the way described in this paper before being used in real ice sheet models.},

abstract = {Ice flow models used to project the mass balance of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica usually rely on the Shallow Ice Approximation (SIA) and the Shallow-Shelf Approximation (SSA), sometimes combined into so-called “hybrid” models. Such models, while computationally efficient, are based on a simplified set of physical assumptions about the mechanical regime of the ice flow, which does not uniformly apply everywhere on the ice sheet/ice shelf system, especially near grounding lines, where rapid changes are taking place at present. Here, we present a new thermomechanical finite element model of ice flow named ISSM (Ice Sheet System Model) that includes higher-order stresses, high spatial resolution capability and data assimilation techniques to better capture ice dynamics and produce realistic simulations of ice sheet flow at the continental scale. ISSM includes several approximations of the momentum balance equations, ranging from the two-dimensional SSA to the three-dimensional full-Stokes formulation. It also relies on a massively parallelized architecture and state-of-the-art scalable tools. ISSM employs data assimilation techniques, at all levels of approximation of the momentum balance equations, to infer basal drag at the ice-bed interface from satellite radar interferometry-derived observations of ice motion. Following a validation of ISSM with standard benchmarks, we present a demonstration of its capability in the case of the Greenland Ice Sheet. We show ISSM is able to simulate the ice flow of an entire ice sheet realistically at a high spatial resolution, with higher-order physics, thereby providing a pathway for improving projections of ice sheet evolution in a warming climate.},

abstract = {Abstract Projections of the sea level contribution from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets (GrIS and AIS) rely on atmospheric and oceanic drivers obtained from climate models. The Earth System Models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) generally project greater future warming compared with the previous Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) effort. Here we use four CMIP6 models and a selection of CMIP5 models to force multiple ice sheet models as part of the Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for CMIP6 (ISMIP6). We find that the projected sea level contribution at 2100 from the ice sheet model ensemble under the CMIP6 scenarios falls within the CMIP5 range for the Antarctic ice sheet but is significantly increased for Greenland. Warmer atmosphere in CMIP6 models results in higher Greenland mass loss due to surface melt. For Antarctica, CMIP6 forcing is similar to CMIP5 and mass gain from increased snowfall counteracts increased loss due to ocean warming.},

Established methods are combined with good software design to yield an adaptable and widely applicable model. A flexible framework for coupling Glimmer to global climate forcing is also described. Testing and benchmarking is of crucial importance if the outputs of numerical models are to be regarded as credible; we demonstrate that Glimmer performs very well against the well-known EISMINT benchmarks and against other analytical solutions for ice flow. Glimmer therefore represents a well-founded and flexible framework for the open-source development of ice sheet modeling.},
