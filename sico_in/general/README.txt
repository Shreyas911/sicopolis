Data file grip_105ka_vostok_gi.dat:
Glacial index assembled from a combination of GRIP d18O and Vostok
dD records (see above).

Data files derived from GRIP d18O (see above) on the GICC05 time scale
(Svensson et al., Clim. Past 4, 47-57, 2008) extended to 104 ka b2k
(I. Seierstad and S. O. Rasmussen, personal communication 2013):

 * GRIP_GICC05_105ka_Vostok_gi.dat

   Glacial index similar to the one described by Greve
   (Ann. Glaciol. 42, 424-432, 2005). Prior to 105 ka b2k it is based
   on the smoothed Vostok dD record, after 104 ka b2k it is based on
   the new GRIP d18O record on the GICC05 time scale [d18O-to-Ts
   conversion done with the quadratic formula by Johnsen et al.
   (Tellus 47B, 624-629, 1995)], and between 105 and 104 ka b2k
   connected by linear interpolation.

 * GRIP_GICC05_105ka_GRIP-old_Delta-Ts_1.dat

   Surface temperature anomaly; d18O-to-Ts conversion done with the
   quadratic formula by Johnsen et al. (1995). Prior to 105 ka b2k
   based on the old GRIP d18O record, after 104 ka b2k based on the
   new GRIP d18O record on the GICC05 time scale, linear interpolation
   in between.

 * GRIP_GICC05_105ka_GRIP-old_Delta-Ts_2.dat

   Similar, but d18O-to-Ts conversion done with a linear formula that
   uses a Delta-T/d18O conversion factor of d = 2.4 degC/permil
   [standard value by Huybrechts
                      (Quaternary Sci. Rev. 21, 203-231, 2002)].
